# Text-to-Speech Converter

This project is a simple text-to-speech (TTS) converter written in Python using the `pyttsx3` library. It converts user input text into spoken words.

## Features

- Converts any text input into speech.
- Uses `pyttsx3`, a text-to-speech conversion library in Python which works offline.
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, and Linux).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-to-speech-converter.git
   cd text-to-speech-converter
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install `pyttsx3` directly if `requirements.txt` is not provided:

   ```sh
   pip install pyttsx3
   ```

## Usage

To run the text-to-speech converter, execute the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python tts_converter.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter the text that you want to convert to speech. After entering the text, the program will convert it into speech and play it aloud.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the program:

```sh
$ python tts_converter.py
Enter the text: Hello, welcome to the text-to-speech converter!
```

The program will then read out the entered text: "Hello, welcome to the text-to-speech converter!"

## Code Explanation

Here's a brief explanation of the code in `tts_converter.py`:

```python
import pyttsx3

# Initialize the TTS engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Get user input
a = input("Enter the text: ")

# Convert text to speech
engine.say(a)

# Play the speech
engine.runAndWait()
```

- `pyttsx3.init()`: Initializes the TTS engine.
- `input("Enter the text: ")`: Prompts the user to enter the text they want to convert to speech.
- `engine.say(a)`: Passes the text to the TTS engine.
- `engine.runAndWait()`: Processes the speech and plays it.
